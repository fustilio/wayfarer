# Wayfarer Development Plan - Parallelization Strategy
                                                                                                            
**Objective:** To outline a strategy for parallelizing the development of Wayfarer features to accelerate t 
development process and improve team efficiency.
                                                                                                            
**Assumptions:**
                                                                                                            
*   Multiple developers are available to work on different features concurrently.
*   Features can be developed independently with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies.
*   A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) is used to track tasks and dependencies.

**Parallelization Strategy:**

The development will be parallelized based on the core feature sets, as defined in the Architecture Documen 

1.  **Content Capture & Organization (Emily):**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Implement Panel Capture (Camera integration, OCR). (Not yet implemented)
        *   Implement My Travel Notes (Data storage, UI). (Basic CRUD, reordering, and distance calculation implemented for Points of Information)
        *   Implement data persistence and offline storage for My Travel Notes. (Not yet implemented)
    *   **Dependencies:**  Camera library, OCR library, local storage solution. (OCR and Camera still not implemented)
    *   **Team:**  Developer 1

2.  **Authentic Cultural Immersion (Ben):**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Implement Hidden Gems (Data fetching, UI).
        *   Implement Local Insights (Data fetching, UI).
        *   Implement map integration for Hidden Gems.
    *   **Dependencies:**  Backend API for Hidden Gems and Local Insights data, map library.
    *   **Team:**  Developer 2

3.  **Local Storytelling Contribution (Carlos):**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Implement Local Story Submission Form (UI, data submission).
        *   Implement submission confirmation.
    *   **Dependencies:**  Backend API endpoint for story submission.
    *   **Team:**  Developer 2

4.  **Profile and Trip Details:**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Implement Profile Screen (UI, data display).
        *   Implement Trip Details Screen (UI, data display).
    *   **Dependencies:**  Data structure for past trips.
    *   **Team:**  Developer 1

**Development Workflow:**

1.  **Sprint Planning:**  Features are broken down into smaller, manageable tasks during sprint planning.   
2.  **Task Assignment:**  Tasks are assigned to developers based on their expertise and the feature set the 
are responsible for.
3.  **Independent Development:**  Developers work independently on their assigned tasks, following coding   
standards and best practices.
4.  **Regular Communication:**  Daily stand-up meetings are held to discuss progress, identify roadblocks,  
and ensure alignment.
5.  **Code Reviews:**  Code reviews are conducted to ensure code quality and identify potential issues.     
6.  **Integration & Testing:**  Features are integrated and tested regularly to ensure compatibility and    
identify integration issues early on.

**Risk Mitigation:**

*   **Dependency Management:**  Clearly define and manage dependencies between features to avoid delays and 
conflicts.
*   **Communication:**  Maintain open communication between developers to ensure everyone is aware of       
progress and potential issues.
*   Code Freezes: Implement code freezes before major releases to stabilize the codebase and minimize the   
risk of introducing new bugs.
                                                                                                            
**Future Considerations:**
                                                                                                            
*   Automated Testing: Implement automated testing to improve code quality and reduce the risk of
regressions.
*   Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build,    
testing, and deployment process.
